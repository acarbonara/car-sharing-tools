# Car Pooling Tools
This is a useful tool to analyze car route traces based on GPS data
and to study car pooling cases.

Run the following command to obtain .csv files that we can plot:
  sh launchEverything.sh <city_dir>

city_dir := is the directory of the city we want to analyze
(so locate car pooling tools in the same folder as the city_dir)
